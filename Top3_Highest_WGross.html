        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>The visualization is a combination of two charts.
            At the bottom, there is a bar chart that shows the shows with the highest weekly earnings (sum) and the rest
            of the shows grouped under the name of "All Other (201)" - 201 is the remaining number of shows. The chart
            is
            ordered in descending order by the amount of income. Using colour differentiates shows the same colours that
            are used in the upper graphic. Hovering over the bars will appear a tooltip with the show's name and the sum
            of gross weekly income. Clicking over the bar, you will select a show and also, you will choose it in the
            upper chart. This can be useful to exclude shows and analyze them individually.</p>
          <p>The upper chart is an error band that shows the weekly gross of the shows (these are the same as in the
            lower
            graph) throughout the selected years. Hovering over the bands, a tooltip will appear showing the date and
            the
            amount of weekly gross income for Q1, median and Q3.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>It can be seen how Hamilton, Lion King and Wicked are top-rated Shows due to weekly gross income. It can be
            inferred that these three represent approximately 20% of the total gross income in the years 2016-2020. This
            is even more outstanding, considering that there are 201 more shows. The error band graph shows how Wicked
            and
            Lion King assume a more balanced income over the years. However, it was rising to a great extent for
            Hamilton
            until reaching the highest peak in 2019. The Q3 for Hamilton assumes the highest weekly income value, which
            might be due to income in December (see Vis1.html).</p>
          <p>Another interesting point that can be seen in the chart above is that the maximum amount (Q3) of gross
            income
            for "All others" does not exceed the minimum amount of income for Wicked (Q1).</p>

        <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>Regarding the lower chart, I decided to use a bar chart because I think they effectively show the
            magnitudes. In the first instance, I had drawn the three top-grossing shows (Hamilton, Lion King and
            Wicked), but I felt that some form of comparison to the rest of the shows was missing. Therefore, I decided
            to add the rest of the shows under the group "All Others (201)". This way, you can show the amount of income
            corresponding to the 201 shows grouped. Since it is a simple chart, I opted for the simplicity that a bar
            chart offers me. I added a tooltip to see what the values of each show are, and thus be able to calculate
            (if you want) relationships (for example, what I mentioned in Insights). By clicking one of the shows or the
            "All others" group, this will filter the top graph. Which I found useful to be able to exclude the shows and
            analyze them individually.</p>
          <p>Regarding the upper graph, I opted to use an error band to show changes over time effectively. Besides, I
            wanted to show a different view of the weekly gross income to not repeat the same line from the previous
            visualisation - Vis1. Consider using a line graph, but the result would have been different. The lines would
            have shown totals and not the Qs and the median, which would not reveal the insights I mentioned above.
            Using an error-band chart, the shows can be differentiated easily and allowing to understand how the
            corresponding values were for the different quartiles. Also, the colours (keeping the same line as the lower
            graph), a bit of opacity, and the lines marking the Q1 / Q3 make the shows' distinction easier. However, add
            a tooltip to view the total median and quartile values quickly and in one place.</p>

        <td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong></td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          I filtered the date field to get the last five years of the dataset, from 2016 to 2020.
          Use a ranking in descending order by the sum of weekly grosses to take the first three shows. The rest are
          grouped under the name "All Others (201)". Use two different aggregations, one to take the gross weekly income
          grouped by date and show. Another to be able to calculate the total grosses per show, this was necessary to
          calculate the ranking.</td>
