                    <p>The visualisation contains a concatenation of two charts: an area chart and a line chart. The
                        charts are connected using interaction on the second one.</p>
                    <p>The first one depicts the number of seats sold and the total capacity for all the shows in the
                        selected years (see data filtering section). Hovering over the areas will show a tooltip with
                        the date (month, year), seats sold and capacity.</p>
                    <p>The second one represents the total grosses for all the shows in the selected years. Hovering
                        over the points will show a tooltip with the date (month, year) and the total grosses. Besides,
                        this chart allows to select or brush the desired range. This will affect the area chart,
                        changing or zoom in/out the date range.</p>

                <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                    <p>The combination of both graphs allows you to view the relationship between tickets sold and the
                        total gross income for the selected years. At first glance, it is clear how in December, sales
                        are much higher (possibly due to the end of the year holidays), especially for 2018 and 2019
                        (215M for both - maximum values of gross income). This corresponds to the number of tickets
                        sold, which is 1.6 million and 1.55 million respectively. However, for 2019, the difference
                        concerning the maximum possible capacity was minor, approximately 150K.</p>
                    <p>Also, it can be seen how in April 2017 and 2018, the number of tickets sold concerning capacity
                        was outstanding, especially for the last, since it registered the best relationship between
                        capacity and attendance, not counting the months of 2020 - COVID 19. Only a difference of 100K
                        and a total income of approximately 200M.</p>
                    <p>Regarding 2020, January and February, they were surprisingly profitable. Even though it is
                        visualised that the capacity for both months under 100K compared to 2019, revenues increased
                        slightly (attendance was very high, more than 92% for both approximately). In March, sales fell
                        dramatically, given that Broadway suspended the activity due to the pandemic.</p>

                <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                    <p>For this visualisation, choose to use a combination of graphs. On the one hand, the main chart is
                        done using a stacked area chart. I chose this type of display as it is effective for showing
                        changes over time. I considered using a line chart, but I realised that the difference between
                        them is better visualised at first glance by using areas. Since the capacity is higher in all
                        cases, I decided to draw the seats sold first and then the capacity. Helping with a bit of
                        opacity, you can visualise the difference quickly and effectively, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>The second chart is also a visualisation over time, but it consists of a single series, gross
                        weekly income. Therefore I opted for a line chart. I added this graph since I thought it was
                        interesting to connect it with the first (primary) graph. At first, I would replicate the
                        graphic above to show an overview and use it simply for brushing and selection. In the end, I
                        chose to use another field (gross weekly income) to be able to show the relationship between the
                        two without losing the brushing and selection to change the main graph.</p>
