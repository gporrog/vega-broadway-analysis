        <td style="vertical-align: top;">These three bar charts represent the average weekly gross, average top price
          and average ticket price. Each bar chart is sorted in descending order by the corresponding field. Clicking
          over one of the theatres will highlight the theatre on the three charts. Hovering the bar charts will show a
          tooltip with the theatre name and the chart's attribute. The theatre called Minskoff is highlighted in blue on
          the three charts on initialization.</td>

        <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>At first glance, the Richard Rodgers Theater has the maximum average weekly earnings and the maximum
            average price of regular and top tickets. Given this theatre owns the hit show Hamilton, and according to <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rodgers_Theatre" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, this theatre
            was awarded more than any other on Broadway.</p>
          <p>Walter Kerr and Richard Rodgers have the highest average ticket prices, yet the second average weekly
            earnings are more than double the first.</p>
          <p>I decided to mark Minskoff (home of the Lion King show) initially since I find its case interesting; it is
            the second with the highest average earnings per week. However, the average price of its tickets is one of
            the lowest. Perhaps, the popularity of Lion King makes the theatre constantly almost complete, allowing
            access to incredible profits, that probably if the ticket increased the price, the theatre could lose
            attendance. A similar case is Gershwin that has an average ticket price that represents more than half that
            of Walter Kerr but is in the top 3 of theatres with more average weekly earnings.</p>
          <p>Overall, it is interesting how not in all cases the three charts are related, representing different
            theatres' business strategies.</p>

        <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p> I chose to use bar charts since they facilitate the visualisation of quantitative data. In turn, I marked
            Minskoff Theater initially to attract attention at first sight, to this case that I found interesting. The
            graphs are ordered in descending order for each of the attributes. For example, this provides immediate
            identification of which theatre has the highest average weekly earnings or which theatre has the lowest
            average ticket.</p>
          <p>I decided to use a tooltip to display the values since specific values are very similar and cannot be
            identified without this tool (e.g. Majestic and Neil Simon top ticket price). Maybe this makes the chart
            more complex, but I think it adds value. Also, I added a connection between the three graphs by clicking on
            one of the theatres; this allows me to immediately identify the clicked theatre's state for the three
            attributes since the others are coloured grey. It might be easier to identify the theatres if the same
            attribute was used to order the three graphs, but it would be even more challenging to identify the highest
            or lowest values. Therefore, the mix of the interaction and the chosen order helps to mitigate this problem.
          </p>
          <p>Another point to mention is that there are many theatres (43) in total. So I decided to take the first 19
            with the most average weekly sales (see filters and data transformation section) and group the rest under
            the name "All Others" (the remaining amount is found in parentheses). Finally, I want to mention that in the
            first instance, I plotted two graphs only, the mean of weekly gross and mean of the top ticket price, but I
            realised that interesting conclusions can be drawn by adding the average ticket price. Another aspect that I
            considered was, use parallel coordinates. I discarded it since it was very complex and challenging to
            visualise, given a large number of theatres.</p>

        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>Filter the data to take the last five years, from 2016 to 2020. Also, grouping by theatre, calculate the
            average of the weekly gross, top ticket price and avg ticket price. The last is the average for the tickets
            sold for a given show, but I had to recalculate the average when grouping by the theatre. Sort the theatres
            by the weekly gross in descending order and take the first 19. Group the rest under the name "All Others
            (24)". The number in parentheses corresponds to the number of theatres in that group.</p>
