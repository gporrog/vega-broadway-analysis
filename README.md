# Broadway analysis - Exploration and Communication using Vega
Exploration and Communication using Vega

## Dataset description
[Broadway Grosses](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-04-28/readme.md)

The dataset contains the weekly grosses for Broadway theatres plus information about attendance and shows. The data is from 1985 until March 2020, when [Broadway suspended the performances](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/12/health/broadway-coronavirus-update/index.html) because of the coronavirus pandemic.

## Changes on the dataset
I made a few changes on the dataset related to naming in the fields and the theatres, plus, I replaced the NA for null.
